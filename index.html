      <h1>Objects in JavaSript</h1>
      <p>please visit the pages to see the homework:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="./pages/task1.html">task 1</a>
          <p>
            Create an object that describes a car (manufacturer, model, year of
            release, average speed) and the following methods for working with
            this object:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a method that displays the car info;</li>
            <li>
              a method for counting a time frame necessary to cover a given
              distance with the average speed.
              <em
                >Note that every 4 hours the driver has to take a 1-hour
                break.</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="./pages/task2.html">task 2</a>
          <p>
            Create an object that contains separately the numerator and the
            denominator of a fraction, and the following functions for working
            with this object:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a function for adding two fraction objects;</li>
            <li>a function for subtracting two fraction objects;</li>
            <li>a function for multiplying two fraction objects;</li>
            <li>a function for dividing two fraction objects;</li>
            <li>a function for simplifying a fraction object</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="./pages/task3.html">task 3</a>
          <p>
            Create an object that describes time (hours, minutes, seconds), and
            the following methods for working with this object:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a method for displaying the time;</li>
            <li>a method for displaying the time;</li>
            <li>
              a method for changing the time by a given amount of seconds;
            </li>
            <li>
              a method for changing the time by a given amount of minutes;
            </li>
            <li>a method for changing the time by a given amount of hours;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note that in the last three methods changing one part may influence
            another. For example, if we add 30 seconds to «20:30:45», we should
            get «20:31:15», not «20:30:75».
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="./pages/task4and5.html">task 4</a>
          <p>
            Create 5 dogs - John, Ivan, Teddy, Rocco and Sparky. All of them
            should have unique ids, ages and addresses.
          </p>
          <p>Show which is the oldest and which is the youngest.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="./pages/task4and5.html">task 5</a>
          <p>
            Use the previous objects and show a list with their names and ages.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="./pages/task6.html">task 6</a>
          <p>
            Create 2 people - Joye and Rachel. They have to have age and a
            greeting which will say “Hi, my name is "NAME" and I am "AGE" old.
            Nice to meet you!”
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="./pages/task7.html">task 7</a>
          <p>
            Create an object circle with a property radius and a method
            calculateArea. The calculateArea method should calculate and return
            the area of the circle using the formula: area = π * radius^2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, create another object smallCircle with its own radius, and use
            the bind method to bind the calculateArea method from circle to
            smallCircle. Call the calculateArea method on smallCircle and print
            the area.
          </p>
